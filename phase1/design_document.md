**Design Document**

*1. Updated Specification:*

We would like to design a service platform that allows users to search, buy and sell items.
It is similar to existing trading websites such as Kijiji, where each user is a buyer and seller at the same time. 
Specifically, a C2C(consumer to consumer) trading platform.

Firstly, the user should be able to create an account and then log into our platform.
This allows users to log in and go through orders and items selling under their accounts. 
They would also be able to post the item(s) they want to sell or purchase item(s) that they wish to buy.
To create a sale post, users must indicate the name of the item they wish to sell, as well as the price and the category it belongs to. 
While running the program, after log in, the user would be able to see all the listed items in stock on our platform. 
For purchasing, users should be able to search by item keywords, seller of the item, or a specific category. 
Users will be able to add the item(s) to their personal cart, and then check out only if they have sufficient money in their wallet. 
Nothing would be changed if they have insufficient funds. The user may top up their wallet to get more money for purchasing.
After successfully paying for the order, users will receive an order number. The user would be able to search for their order by using
order number; Finding the order will show the following information: buyer name, seller name, ordered item(s), the amount paid to the user.
