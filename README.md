## Instructions of using this program.

This is **phase 2** of the CSC207 project by team Hairless Codemen.
We created a second-hand market program let users can buy and sell items in the market.
The skeleton program completes a simple buy and registration progress and this README would state how to use the program.

## 1 How to use the program
Run the Entry class in the src.main.java.UI. Our program would show up right away

Select a **Font** that you feel most comfortable with. The fonts that can be selected are number 15 to number 20.
Then press "OK" to get into the login page.

Choose **Register** before Login if you are a new user. The format of Username and Passwords **Is limited**. Your password
have to contain at least 8 characters which need to include one upper letter, one lower letter, one digit, and one special character.
After registration, you would be able to **Login**. 

Successful login would lead you to the homepage of our program. At the top is your **Wallet** and the amount of money in your wallet.
The amount of money in the wallet would be used for shopping on the platform. 
If you want to load money for shopping, type the amount of money you want to load in the box and click "Load".

Next to Wallet is the **Change Password** button which you can use to change the password of your account. Notice your new password
should also follow the limitation.

For **Buy** and **Cart**. The two boxes in the middle of the pages are displacements of the items selling on the platform and your cart.
If there are any items you are interested in the "Want to buy" box, left-click on the item and choose to "add it to the cart"
If there is an item in your cart, but you are not interested in it anymore. left-click on the item and choose to" remove it from my cart"

Click the **Sell** button if there's anything you wish to push onto the platform to sell.
Input the detail of the item requested on the selling page (Item name, Category, Price, and Qty) and click sell.
If the item was successfully pushed then a "Successfully added" notification would come up.
Go back to the homepage now you should be able to see the item you pushed in the "Want to buy" box.

In the sell frame, there is a new box below the "Sell" and "Back" button called **Orders you sold**
This Text box will show all the orders you have sold if any of your pushed items had been bought by anyone else on the platform.

If there is a particular item you want to buy on the platform. Use **Search** to find it.  You can search Item by the user,
item name, category, and search your orders by order id. The Search window would return all the items they found and if your target item shows up in the window. Left-click on it to add it to the cart.

After adding all the items you wish to buy into your cart t, choose **Checkout**.
The order would be placed successfully if the item is in stock, and you have enough amount of money to buy it in your wallet.
Otherwise, a warning would come up. Click the Order button to check any previous orders in this account.

You can check your **Order** purchased by clicking on the "Order" button. It would list all the orders this user purchased on the platform.

Finally, if you want to finish using the software. **Click on the cross button on the top right** to leave the platform.
Only then the user data will be stored and after logging back in the user will be able to access our platform in the future.
