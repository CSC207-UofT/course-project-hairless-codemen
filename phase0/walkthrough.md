**Scenario Walk Through**   


Each user on the platform can log in with their username and password to begin shopping. Each item in the platform has a 
name, a price, the information about the person who listed it, and a category it belongs to.  

Users can search for items based on their names or categories and add desired items to cart. They can search for items 
in the cart and buy items from the cart using money in their wallet. Users can also load money into their wallets for 
shopping. After buying several items, the buyer will receive a list of order numbers, each of which represents an order 
of items from a specific owner. The buyer can use these order numbers to search for items they bought. Besides, each 
user can also list items they want to sell onto the platform for others to see.
