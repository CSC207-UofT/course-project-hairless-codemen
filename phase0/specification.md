**Specification**

We would like to design a service platform that allows users to search, buy and sell items.
It is similar to existing trading websites such as Kijiji, where each user is a buyer and seller
at the same time. Specifically, a C2C(consumer to consumer) trading platform.

Firstly, the user should be able to create an account and then log into our platform.
This allows users to login in and go through orders and items selling under their accounts.They would also be able to post the item(s) they want to sell or purchase item(s) that they wish to buy.
To create a sale post, users must indicate the name of the item they wish to sell, as well as the price and the category it belongs to. While running the program, after login in the user would be able to see all the items in our market
listed. For purchasing, users will be able to add the item(s) to their personal cart,
and then check out by paying from their wallet. If the amount in their wallet is enough for the order then the order would be successful. The user can top-up their wallet to get enough amount of money for purchasing.
After paying for the order, users will receive an order number. The user would be able to find their order by using
order number, finding the order will show the following information: buyer name, seller name, ordered item(s), the amount paid to the user.
Also, if users want to find a target product they can use search in our program by using the keyword or categories of that product.
