**Part I: Adhesion of Principles of Universal Design:**

*Principle 1: Equitable Use*

We provide the same functionality for different users, protect their own privacy and security using our login system. 
Our design does not exclude any user with diverse abilities.

*Principle 2: Flexibility in Use*

We designed different search options, a number of different items stored on our system, and provided users with the 
feature of listing their own items onto our system. In this way, we have provided every user using our system the 
flexibility of "choices" based on their individual preferences. The program accomodates right and left-handed use and 
provides adaptability to each user's own pace of using the platform.

*Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use*

On our UI level, we have provided clear instructions and messages for users that use our system. We believe the design
of features, as well as the apperances of our UI, does not go against intuition and user expectations. After each task, 
such as buying or selling, we would provide messages for the state of the transaction and other important information
(such as the orders generated).


*Principle 4: Perceptible Information*



*Principle 5: Tolerance for Error*

Through catching a variety of exceptions in our program and adding prompt messges for users giving invalid inputs, we 
have made sure that we did our best in minimizing possible unintended consequences of the program from user's accidental
actions. Fail safe features and warnings about errors can be found on our UI level.


*Principle 6: Low Physical Effort*

Since the UI of our system is a desktop application, all physical efforts required for using our system is the physical 
effort of clicking the mouse and the keyboard input, which minimizes fatigue. In our system, we minimized repeated 
actions, and users do not need to click for a lot of 
times in order to complete a transaction or other features in our system.

*Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Us*

With our design, our Program is adaptable for different sizes of displays. Also, since our program is offline, users do
not need internet access to use our program, which further eliminates any constraints on the use of our trading platform.

**Part II: Targeted User of the Program**


Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to 
customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, 
a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people
who do not read braille.
