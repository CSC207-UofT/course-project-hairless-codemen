**Part I: Adhesion of Principles of Universal Design:**

*Principle 1: Equitable Use*

We provide the same functionality for different users, protect their own privacy and security using our login system. 
Our design does not exclude any user with diverse abilities.

*Principle 2: Flexibility in Use*

We designed different search options, a number of different items stored on our system, and provided users with the 
feature of listing their own items onto our system. In this way, we have provided every user using our system the 
flexibility of "choices" based on their individual preferences. The program accomodates right and left-handed use and 
provides adaptability to each user's own pace of using the platform.

*Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use*

On our UI level, we have provided clear instructions and messages for users that use our system. We believe the design
of features, as well as the appearances of our UI, does not go against intuition and user expectations. After each task, 
such as buying or selling, we would provide messages for the state of the transaction and other important information
(such as the orders generated).


*Principle 4: Perceptible Information*

On UI level, we choose not to put any background/colour since we wish to maximize legibility of our essential 
information(what to sell and what to buy). Having unnecessary background could become a distraction for some users. And
the instruction on what to do is clear. UI will pop up a window giving or asking the users what they should do. 

*Principle 5: Tolerance for Error*

Through catching a variety of exceptions in our program and adding prompt messages for users giving invalid inputs, we 
have made sure that we did our best in minimizing possible unintended consequences of the program from user's accidental
actions. Fail-safe features and warnings about errors can be found on our UI level.


*Principle 6: Low Physical Effort*

Since the UI of our system is a desktop application, all physical efforts required for using our system is the physical 
effort of clicking the mouse and the keyboard input, which minimizes fatigue. In our system, we minimized repeated 
actions, and users do not need to click for a lot of 
times in order to complete a transaction or other features in our system.

*Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Us*

With our design, our Program is adaptable for different sizes of displays. Also, since our program is offline, users do
not need internet access to use our program, which further eliminates any constraints on the use of our trading platform.

**Part II: Targeted User of the Program**

Our platform is designed in the language of English, the main audience is customers who know how to use internet and
are familiar with online shopping. It might be slightly user-unfriendly to the audience who do not understand English. 

Our platform welcomes anyone who wants to sell and buy their items, we provide a free and open market for anyone 
who wants to trade online. It is very good for people who want to buy cheaper items or people with idle items in their 
homes. Sellers can moderate price to whatever they believe is reasonable, and buyers could purchase
the items with commonly a lower price than purchasing anywhere else (because it could be either brand new or 
second handed).

However, since our platform does not certify our sellers, it might be risky if the buyer wants to buy a brand-new 
authentic item. Our platform does not guarantee the authenticity and reliability of the item.
