**Specification**

We would like to design a service platform that allows users to search, buy and sell items.
It is similar to existing trading websites such as Kijiji, where each user is a buyer and seller
at the same time. Specifically, a C2C(consumer to consumer) trading platform.

Firstly, the user should be able to create an account and then log into our platform. They would 
also need to be able to post item(s) they want to sell or purchase item(s) that they wish to buy. 
To create a sale post, users must indicate the name of the item they wish to sell, as well as price 
and the categories it belongs to. For buying, users will be able to add item(s) to their personal cart, 
and then check out by paying from their wallet. After paying for an order, users will receive an order 
number. Tracking the order number,  it will show the user the following information: buyer name, seller 
name, ordered item(s), amount paid.
